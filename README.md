# CustomFilteringFunction

Â ðŸ”¥TASK: Building a Custom Filtering Function in Rust
Task Details
In this task, you will create a custom filtering function in Rust that allows filtering elements from a given collection based on a specific condition. The goal is to implement a beginner-friendly solution that avoids using closures to simplify the understanding of the code.

### Checklist
* Create a new Rust project and open the main.rs file.
* Define the FilterCondition struct with the desired type for filtering.
* Implement the is_match method on the FilterCondition struct.
* Define the custom_filter function to filter elements based on the condition.
* Create a collection and a FilterCondition object in the main function.
* Call the custom_filter function and store the result.
* Print the filtered result to the console.
* Compile and run the program to test its functionality.
